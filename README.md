# Artificial Intelligence By Example
This is the code repository for [Artificial Intelligence By Example](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/artificial-intelligence-example?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788990547), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Artificial Intelligence by Example is your starting point to understanding how AI is built with the help of intriguing examples. Your will focus on how to become an adaptive thinker and understand the relationship between the concepts explained in the book and real-life situations. Using some of the best AI examples right from a simple chess engine to a cognitive chatbot, you will learn how to tackle a machine you are competing with. You will learn about advanced machine learning models, how to apply AI to blockchain and IoT, and develop the emotional quotient in chatbots using neural networks. You will focus more on how you can design the AI solution easily rather than complex machine learning and deep learning techniques. Artificial Intelligence by Example will be a starter kit for you to develop AI applications on your own.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All chapters contain code files and data files as required.

The code will look like the following:
```
MS1='full'
MS2='space'
I=['1','2','3','4','5','6']
for im in range(2):
```

Artificial intelligence projects rely on three factors:

Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). This implies having a practical view of how solutions can be used, not just developed. Find real-life examples around you to extend the case studies presented in the book.
Applied mathematics and algorithms. Do not skip the mathematical equations if you have the energy to study them. AI relies heavily on mathematics. There are plenty of excellent websites that explain the mathematics used in the book.
Development and production.
An artificial intelligence solution can be directly used on a cloud platform machine learning site (Google, Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, and others) online or with APIs. In the book, Amazon, IBM, and Google are described. Try to create an account of your own to explore cloud platforms.

Development still remains critical for artificial intelligence projects. Even with a cloud platform, scripts and services are necessary. Also, sometimes, writing an algorithm is mandatory because the ready-to-use online algorithms are insufficient for a given problem. Explore the programs delivered with the book. They are open source and free.
